- Detection of potential XSS vulnerabilities
- Detection of potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities
- Detection of potential CSRF vulnerabilities
- Verbose output option for detailed scanning information

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dawoodsahi/web_app_vulnerability_scanner.git
   cd web_app_vulnerability_scanner
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
